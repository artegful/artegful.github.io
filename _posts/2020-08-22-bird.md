<h2>About</h2>
<p>Urban Bird is a <b>Flappy-like game</b> set in a polluted industrial city, where birds struggle to fly because of pipes. Flappy Bird is a pretty simplistic game that got insanely popular, that's why I recreated it in my own style.</p>
<p>Gameplay of this type of games is really well-known. This small project is my first student year coursework, that took little to no time to develop - 1 day. After that I polished it with better UI, sprites and parallax effect.</p>
