<h2>About</h2>
<p>Laser Defender is a <b>shoot em up</b> 2D Unity game inspired by japanese bullet hell games that I used to play as a kid on my dad's old computer. Game was developed fully by me, I used these wonderful <a href="https://ravenmore.itch.io/pixel-space-shooter-assets">free assets</a>.</p>
<p>The gameplay idea is really simple: you have to survive as many waves as you can on a single level. I tried to make the game feel as dynamic as possible with the help of VFX, music and unstoppable waves of different enemies.</p>
