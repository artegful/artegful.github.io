<h2>About</h2>
<p>I started my serious game dev journey from Yatzy. It is a classic board game, that can be played competitively with an ai or a friend. This mobile version of the well known yahtzee game, designed to be a unique mix of luck and strategy. Can you roll the right dice combinations to beat the competition? Every round you roll the 5 dice is an exciting challenge to rack up the highest score.</p>

<h2>My contribution</h2>
<p>I designed and created daily challenge system for this game in order to improve retention. After this project I learned, how it feels to be part of a team and work on a really big piece of code using MVP design.
