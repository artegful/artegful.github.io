My name is <b>Klimovich Artsemi</b> and I am a Game Developer. 
Ever since I was a kid, games have been my passion. They have got me into programming and learning game engines. Games are a perfect combo of creativity and technology. I am mostly fond of second aspect, but first one never lets you get bored. Programming and designing game architecture is like a never-ending puzzle, that I am engaged in solving.

My first team experience in game dev was when me and my classmate decided to create a simple mobile game, but lack of expertise brought our project down. That was the time, when I started working hard to become skilled enough to embody almost any game idea. One day I found a post about a small team of mobile developers looking for a novice, that can help them develop small features and exterminate bugs. That’s how I got my first (almost) professional contract. And here I am today, a developer at SKRGames, working on mobile games.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
At home I continue to work, but on my own projects. Participating in game jams challenges my creativity, programming and problem solving skills. I like to browse and try other indie enthusiasts’ projects, because they are full of really inspiring and fresh ideas. My other hobby is films. I enjoy watching them, because they let you see the world from a different perspective and learn something new.
